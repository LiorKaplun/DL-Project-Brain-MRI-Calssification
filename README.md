## Background
Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. 
This project’s goal was to train a DL model that classifies brain MRI images to 4 Alzheimer’s severities: 
Non-Demented, Verry Mild-Demented, Mild-Demented and Moderate demented. 
Below you can see examples of MRI images from each class.
The motivation to use DL for Alzheimer’s classification comes from the tedious process patients need to go through to be diagnosed – multiple visits to doctors, 
mental status tests, physical and neurological exams and brain imaging. 
If a DL learning model can be trained to high classification accuracy, a brain MRI is the only step that will be needed.
In addition to designing a CNN classifier we also used transfer learning on other models and analysed their performance on the data. 
This gives a perspective of which models perform better on this task with respect to training times, accuracy and memory.
